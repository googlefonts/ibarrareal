value = "This font is fruit of a wider initiative dating back to 2007, when Calcografía Nacional, Spain’s national and historical engraving workshop, with the support of Spain’s Ministry for Industry, organised a project directed by José María Ribagorda focusing on and highlighting Spain’s typographic heritage.\012Nowadays, nobody questions the significance and growth of the Spanish language as a tool for communication between different countries and cultures around the world and the intangible capital  as well as the economic impact involved in the use of signs that could be recognised as belonging to our cultural heritage (the original typography includes not only characters, but also vignettes ceded by celebrated Latin-American and spanish designers: Manuel Alvarez Junco,Andreu Balius Planelles, Didac Ballester, Paco Bascunan, Jose Maria Cerezo, Alberto Corazon, Oyer Corazon, Pablo Cosgaya, Ruben Fontana, Javier Garcia del Olmo Jose Gil Nogues, Pepe Gimeno, Fernando Gutierrez, Juan Martinez, Laura Meseguer, Juan Antonio Moreno, Juan Nava, Miguel Ochando,  Joseph Patau Bellart, Alejandro Paul. Marc Salinas, Emilio Torne, Alex Trochut, Roberto Turegano Moratalla) . \012This project is aimed at filling an important gap, for the myriad of texts now written in the Spanish-speaking community use font types created in other cultural milieus. This is why we believe it is important, as our language becomes more relevant, to associate this reality with the recovery of the Imprenta Real types that were developed in Spain in the eighteenth century. Thus we will be able to make them better known, making them more accessible by means of the digital media available to us now. \012The source Ibarra Real is Open File License now. This means that it will not only be freely usable and distributed, but its code can be reason for study and adaptation. The production of this source was always aimed at the patrimonial and cultural recovery of one of the best examples of Spanish writing and Spanish printing. The Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, sponsor of the project through the National Calcography, thus assures its character of public and common patrimony of all by what its distribution has been always free.Before reaching this stage, in 2015 I decided that the first collaborator in touching the source should be Octavio Pardo. Octavio, was the first student of the prestigious  University of Reading, that realized for its Master of Types Design a work about Ibarra Real. It is logical that was the person who I asked for a revision of the font to improve it from personal criteria, free of constraints. It has been a pleasure to observe his work, to discuss it with him.\012changes related to the enlargement of glyphs for Latin languages, legibility, spacing and retouching of some glyphs whose design had to be adapted especially in italics and the direction of its axis. To differentiate it from the first version we have called it RAE, referring to it has been Revised, Open and Extended, or as it would be in Spanish \"Revisada, Abierta y Extendida\". The ornaments of the first version have not been incorporated in this first version while I waiting for their authors to incorporate their vignettes with the OFL license\012\0122016 revised version: José María Ribagorda and Octavio Pardo";
